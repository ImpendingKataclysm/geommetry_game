# geommetry_game
 This game generates a rectangle with randomized coordinates and asks the player 
 to guess a coordinate that falls within that rectangle as well as guessing the
 area of the rectangle.


In the command line, the player is shown the coordinates for the rectangle's 
bottom-left and top-right corners, then prompted to guess the x- and y-coordinates 
of a point within the rectangle. The player is then prompted to guess the area
of the rectangle. 


After the player has entered their guesses, a final output message indicates 
whether the player guessed correctly. The rectangle and the point guessed by the
player are rendered in a turtle GUI.
